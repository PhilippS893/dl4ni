    "A __hyperparameter__ is a variable or setting that controls the learning process. Hyperparameters are \"known\" before the learning process begins and are not changed during training. They should never be confused with the __model parameters__ (e.g., weights and biases). \n",

    "* the learning rate\n",

    "\n",
    "How we use wandb (adapted from [docs](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps)):\n",
    "1. Write config: Define the variables and ranges to sweep over and determine the search strategy. Wandb offers a few options:\n",
    "    * grid: run all possible combinations\n",
    "    * random: randomly choose a user supplied __n__ number of parameter combinations\n",
    "    * and Bayesian search\n",
    "2. Initialize the search: Wandb hosts a controller and coordinates between the agent(s) that execute the sweep. They can be local or distributed.\n",
    "3. Launch agent(s): If we wanted to use multiple computers, we could use the same command to execute one training process with a selected parameter combination. The agent(s) ask(s) the sweep server what hyperparameter combination to try next, and then they execute the runs.\n",
    "4. We visualize the results: we can do this locally on our computers or we can use the wandb platform to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get into it then.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to set ourselfs a goal. Let's say we want to use a ```SimpleLinearModel``` to classify handwritten digits. We saw that the default settings of the ```SimpleLinearModel``` worked quite well but we cannot be sure that those parameters yield the best results. We therefore decided to do a parameter search over the number of neurons per layer, the learning rate, and the number of epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways in which we can do it.\n",
    "1. Defining a python ```dict```\n",
    "2. Loading a .yaml file\n",
