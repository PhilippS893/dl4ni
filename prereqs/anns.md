# What are Neural Nets?

<p align="justify">Artificial neural networks and deep learning have their beginning in the 1940s.
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (cite) were among the first to create a computational model
of neural networks. One also cannot forget about D. O. Hebb who introduced a learning hypothesis 
based on neural plasticity that we today know as Hebbian Learning (cite). Farley and Wesley Clark were
the first to simulate a Hebbian network in 1954 (cite). 

The first artifical neuron, the perceptron, was already created in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt (cite)</p>

## Why should we care as Neuroscientists?

<p align="justify">Artificial neural nets may inform us about brain function. On the other hand,  the brain may inform 
how design new architectures for neural nets. 

A great example for why neural nets are interesting for neuroscientists is described in a paper by 
Cichy and Kaiser(see [Deep Neural Networks as Scientific Models](https://sociales.uexternado.edu.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/S-2-Cognition_AI_DNN.pdf)).
