# Welcome to an introduction to DeepLearning for Neuroimaging

This book is co-developed with my PhD thesis. It is meant to be an introduction to use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for neuroimaging projects. 

While some of the contents within this book are based on my PhD project, some sections were specifically designed to help guide newcomers and provide some good practices on how to use DNNs for neuroimaging or even in general. 

In this book you can expect to cover the following topics:
