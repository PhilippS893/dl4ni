# An introduction to DeepLearning for Neuroimaging

<p align="justify">This book is co-developed with my PhD thesis. It is meant to be an introduction to use 
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for neuroimaging projects.

While some of the contents within this book are based on my PhD project, some sections were specifically 
designed to help guide newcomers and provide some good practices on how to use DNNs for neuroimaging or 
even in general. 

That said, the reader should be aware that the current versions of this book and its code are subject to rapid change.
If time, motivation, and skill allow my goals for the code/toolbox are to be used with a graphical user interface. 
My hope is that with this book and code we can make experiments that leverage the power of deep learning to be more
consistent, understandable, and reproducible.

Best, <br>
