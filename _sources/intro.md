# An introduction to DeepLearning for Neuroimaging

<p align="justify">This book is co-developed with my PhD thesis. It is meant to be an introduction to use 
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for neuroimaging projects.

While some of the contents within this book are based on my PhD project, some sections were specifically 
designed to help guide newcomers and provide some good practices on how to use DNNs for neuroimaging or 
even in general. 

That said, please be aware that the current version of this book and its code are subject to rapid change.
Further, I realize that some citations might be missing at the moment. It certainly is not my inention to claim credit
except for my own code. The citations *will* be included. Please notify me directly if you can identify a missing citation
or cross-reference to original work. 

Thank you and best wishes, <br>
Philipp
