<p align="justify">Philipp Seidel is the main author of this book. He is currently a Doctoral candidate of the Graduate School of Emotion Dysfunctions (GRK2174) at the University Regensburg. His supervisor is Prof. Dr. Jens V. Schwarzbach, the leader of the Biomedical Imaging department at the University of Regensburg. 
In his PhD project, Philipp develops a lab-internal pipeline to use 3D Deep Learning approaches for future real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. The focus in his work is to ensure that the results of the trained artificial neural networks are robust and confident in their decision. This is important as future real-time experiments rely on accurate and confident classification of emotions derived from brain states. This becomes especially important when patients are involved in clinical studies.</p>
