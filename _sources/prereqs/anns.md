# What are Neural Nets?

<p align="justify">The beginning of neural networks...</p>

## Why should we care as Neuroscientists?

<p align="justify">Artificial neural nets may inform us about brain function. On the other hand,  the brain may inform 
how design new architectures for neural nets. 

A great example for why neural nets are interesting for neuroscientists is described in a paper by 
Cichy and Kaiser(see [Deep Neural Networks as Scientific Models](https://sociales.uexternado.edu.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/S-2-Cognition_AI_DNN.pdf)).
